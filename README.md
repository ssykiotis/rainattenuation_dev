# rainpropagation_dev

Development of ns-3 module for mmWave rain attenuation.

Classes:
  1) Control: contains essential information for the Model, like location coordinates, frequency etc.
  2) RainSimulator: class that contains simulated rain rate values and the corresponding rain attenuation for a year.
  
  
  Progress: 10/23  functions implemented : ~44% done
